Time: 5 hours

- Brainstormed what I wanted on my keyboard
- Learned how to make an 80% keyboard (it's my first time)
- Started working on schematic

My biggest issue was to find a proper MCU for the keyboard that wasn't too expensive. Luckily I came across the raspberry pi pico. With the pico, creating the schematic was much easier.

Day 2

time: 8 hours

- Started routing the PCB

Routing the PCB was fairly easy and after I finished, I got 0 errors from DRC first try! I also changed the PCB design a little by adding field zones. It makes the PCB looks so much better!

It wasn't until I finished wiring till I realized that my pico was too low. But instead I'll just make a longer hole so that the cable can reach the pico.

- Then I got on Fusion and I started to work on the case
- I created the bottom and top case fairly quickly
- I then made a little opening to show off the silkscreen

The case that I made is very similar to the hackpad case that I made, this time I wanted to show off some of the PCB design.

Don't worry there's more than enough space for the cable to connect to the pico!
